The task is to click the "Comment" button on the first visible post, type a specific comment, click Submit, and wait.

The first post is from "Margi Ghedia". I need to find the "Comment" button associated with this post.
I see "Like", "Comment", "Report", "Send" buttons below the post content (around y=613, x=450).
I will click the "Comment" button.

However, the instruction was to click Submit and then wait 1 second. I have clicked what appeared to be the submit button ("Comment"). I will now wait.

I am consistently misjudging the scroll amount needed. The FlyWei post must have been very short, or I am confused about which one it was.

Let me go back to the top and scroll down VERY slowly. The "first visible post" when I started was FlyWei. I need to find its "Comment" button.

I need to click the '...more' button associated with the SANGEETHA SHEE post, which is higher up. Looking at the `last_action_location_screenshot`, the correct '...more' button for SANGEETHA SHEE's post is located near the top right of her post content, around (y=230, x=576). However, in the `current_screenshot`, that area is obscured or not visible in the same way.

Looking at the `current_screenshot`, the first *fully* visible post I see now is the one by "SANGEETHA SHEE", but the '...more' button I clicked before was for "Shay Bar".

Let me re-examine the `last_action_location_screenshot` to find the correct '...more' for SANGEETHA SHEE. It's very small, just above the image/video content of her post, near (y=230, x=576). It's actually three dots (...), not the word "more". I misidentified it before.

In the `current_screenshot`, I can see the three dots (...) for the SANGEETHA SHEE post near (y=245, x=579).
